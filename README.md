Film recocmendation service which looks for people who think like you and suggests the films they like. Featuring a Tinderfied UI.
Example of methods:
Two users are created and rate films similarly, so the films that 'you' has liked that 'me' has not seen are reccomended.
Also intended to reccomend the optimum film for a group to watch (party of more than 1 where the avg predicted grade would be maximised).
